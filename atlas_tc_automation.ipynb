      "1. Today, I successfully launched the Inovalon 3P remote services in Charlotte, ensuring that all stakeholders were able to access the new service in the most efficient manner. I worked with the team to troubleshoot any technical issues, communicated with clients to understand their needs, and ensured that the project was completed on-time and within budget.\n",

      "2. I created and developed an optimized project story schema for the Inovalon project, which will help to streamline the project process and ensure that all stakeholders have the information they need to make informed decisions. I also worked with the team to thoroughly review the schema and ensure that it meets the needs of the project.\n",
